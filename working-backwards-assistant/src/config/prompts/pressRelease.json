Include 1-2 selected metrics that matter to customers\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n- The paragraph MUST clearly answer the Working Backwards questions (who is the customer, what problem are you solving, what is the benefit)\n- Only include metrics and details that customers care about (cost, speed, availability, etc.)\n- Keep the entire paragraph to 4-5 sentences maximum\n- Assume no one will read past this paragraph\n\nExample of a good first paragraph:\n\"TORONTO, CANADA—June 15, 2024—SkillBridge today announced its professional certification platform that helps internationally-trained professionals navigate recertification requirements in their new countries. When moving abroad, professionals like doctors, engineers, and teachers can use SkillBridge to create personalized certification roadmaps based on their existing credentials and target country.
